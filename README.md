# Snake game
 
## Motivation
This is my learn by doing project. I've never done any game development so I decided to learn a bit more about game loops and game mechanics by recreating the classic snake game.

## Project status: WIP
At this point the program:
- renders simple canvas;
- generates "game world" based on given dimensions; 
- places apples at random at given rate (red cells);
- places 3-cells-long snake at starting at the center of the "world" (blue cells).

*Further features are being added to the dev branch.

## Tech/framework used
