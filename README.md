# Snake game
 
## Motivation
This is my learn by doing project. I've never done any game development so I decided to learn a bit more about game loops and game mechanics by recreating the classic snake game.

## Project status: WIP
At this point the snake game is functional, but needs work in terms of graphics, score counter, etc.

## Tech/framework used
<b>This project uses</b>
- vanilla JavaScript
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for deployment

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

> `npm start`
Launches the dev server on http://localhost:8080/.

> `npm run build`
Runs webpack build for deployment.

> `npm run lint`
Runs eslint with [eslint-config-salt](https://github.com/appliedtechnology/eslint-config-salt) configuration.

## Installation and usage
First install all the dependencies:

> `npm install`

Once the installation is done you can simply start the app by running:

> `npm start`
